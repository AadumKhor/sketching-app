# Sketching

The project - initially posted on Medium - has been revamped to accommodate some future articles on my new blog. All the branches present on this repository will represent a single state of the project as per the blog. All latest, and hopefully the best, practices are there in this revised version. 

PRs and suggestions are most welcome. Any comments for this project are also welcome in the form of Issues. Stay tuned for updates to the repository! 

Branches and project states : 
1. Master -> Original app. Normal sketching concepts & canvas description. Almost the same app as the one initially shared. Minor adjustments and null safety included
